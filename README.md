# EtcordSharp
Etcord is a voice chat platform created by Etkot. EtcordSharp is the official C# implementation of Etcord. 

EtcordSharp is intended to have a server, but also a client for every platform. Currently the client has support for only windows. Server is cross-platform.

## Building and usage
To build EtcordSharp you will need Visual Studio 2019. 

Clone the repo, open EtcordSharp.sln and build all projects. 

Currently there are no public Etcord servers hosted, so you'll have to host your own.
